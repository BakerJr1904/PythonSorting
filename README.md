# PythonSorting
### How do you sort in Python?
The easiest way to sort is with the sorted(list) function, which takes a list and returns a new list with those elements in sorted order. The original list is not changed. It's most common to pass a list into the sorted() function, but in fact it can take as input any sort of iterable collection.
